// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements =  "The specific requirements of the program are defined. At this stage, the development team may also decide what programming language should be used to build the program.";
const design = "This process involves creating the user interface and determining how the program will function.";
const implementation ="This includes programming the source code, creating the graphics, and compiling the assets into an executable program.";
const testingAndIntegration ="This allows the developer to catch unknown issues and fix any bugs that arise in the program.";
const maintain ="After a software application has been released, there may still be additional bugs or feature requests submitted by users. The development team must maintain the software by fixing bugs and adding new features.";
